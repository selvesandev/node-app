# Node JS App
This is second part of the (node-express) references https://github.com/selvesandev/node-express  
Go through the (node-express) before this.

This is a very basic node js app that uses a json data for it's content. This is a simple web page that follows a MVC design pattern with Express framework and does not include node js advanced features.
All the data used by this app is in data.json file in the root (./) directory.
